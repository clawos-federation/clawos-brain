# 🗺️ OpenClaw Strategic Plan (Orchestration 6.6)

**Status**: Post-Migration Finalization
**Date**: 2026-02-13
**Author**: Gemini CLI (Simulating GM Agent)

## 1. Executive Summary
The "moving house" (migration) is 95% complete. Core logic and workspace files are intact. The primary friction points are (1) credential synchronization between isolated agent directories and (2) structural inconsistency between the runtime `agents/` and the source `workspace/agents/`. This plan outlines the final steps to reach "10/10 Perfection."

## 2. Phase 1: Structural Integrity (Immediate)
*   **Action 1: Unify Agent Directories.** Convert `agents/` into a symlink to `workspace/agents/` to ensure single-source-of-truth for configurations.
    *   *Warning*: Backup existing `agents/` specific state before symlinking.
*   **Action 2: Fix Auth Provider Mismatch.** Investigate why `google-antigravity` fails despite correct keys. Verify if the provider should be `google-gemini-cli` with a specific model alias instead.
*   **Action 3: Establish MEMORY.md.** Create a master long-term memory file in the workspace root to stabilize agent identity across restarts.

## 3. Phase 2: Model Routing Optimization
*   **Strategic Titan Tier**: Reserve `google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-6-thinking` for GM's periodic audits and complex refactoring.
*   **Production Codex Tier**: Normalize all coding tasks to `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`.
*   **Eco Logistics Tier**: Force `opencode/glm-4.7-free` for all trivial `ls`, `cat`, and status check commands to preserve quota.

## 4. Phase 3: Capability Expansion
*   **Enable Subagent Allowlist**: Update `openclaw.json` to explicitly allow `devagent` and `testagent` for direct delegation from Henry.
*   **Heartbeat Activation**: Re-enable heartbeats for `GM` (6h) and `DevAgent` (on-demand) to ensure system self-healing.

## 5. Success Metrics
*   **Zero Fallbacks**: Strategic tasks should succeed on the first attempt without falling back to lower-tier models.
*   **Auth Purity**: `auth-profiles.json` should contain zero `errorCount` and zero `cooldownUntil` after 24 hours of operation.
*   **Memory Depth**: `MEMORY.md` should contain at least 5 key architectural decisions from the past 7 days.
